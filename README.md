## BFS, DFS
Breadth-first and depth-first search are two exhaustive search algorithms. BFS is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, while DFS often finds a (possibly sub-optimal) solution faster.

## Tree search vs Graph Search, Uniform Cost Search
Graph search and tree search can both be used to explore the same spaces. The primary difference is that graph search does NOT expand a single node more than once, while binary search may return to the same node and expand it multiple times. Both Tree Search and Graph Search are variations of Uniform Cost Search.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
A variant of Uniform Cost Search that finds the shortest path between all nodes on a weighted di-graph.

## A* Search
A* search is a type of informed search and is useful for searching a weighted graph. A* Search makes use of both the cost of the path to the current location and a heuristic function to estimate the value of each state to make its search decisions.
